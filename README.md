Just a basic walk through for how to train a bert-sentiment model with a lora adaptor. Without a lora the process is super similar, you just train the model directly instead of the lora. I think the best thing to do would be to train both,
but I could not find where I did that. Don't follow this to a T, it was not used!

Example of training bert without a lora is provided.
