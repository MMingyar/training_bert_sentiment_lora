An example of training a lora adaptor on top of a sentiment bert model. Without a lora the process is super similar, you just train the model directly instead of the lora. I think the best thing to do would be to train both, but I could not find where I did that. 

This code was a trial and was not used in any project, so use anything here at your own risk. 

Example of training bert without a lora is provided.
